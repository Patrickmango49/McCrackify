**Music, your way.** A browser-based music player from McCrack.

Search for music, play YouTube videos in the built-in player, queue search results, skip between tracks, save liked songs, and make playlists — no APK required.

## Features

- YouTube-powered search with multiple public search backends.
- In-page YouTube player for full-length videos when the video owner and YouTube allow embedding.
- Automatically advances through the current search queue when a track ends.
- Skips to the next queued track if YouTube reports that a video cannot be embedded.
- Liked songs, playlists, shuffle, repeat, volume, seeking, and a queue saved/managed in your browser.
- Short Apple Music/iTunes previews are only a fallback when YouTube search services are unavailable.

## Important playback notes

McCrackify does not host music files. Full-length playback uses YouTube's official embedded player and follows YouTube's availability, region, account, and embedding restrictions. Some videos may not permit embedding, and public search backends may be unavailable or rate-limited. If search fails, use the link to open the query on YouTube Music. No browser-only implementation can guarantee that every song is playable.

## Publishing

This project is published with GitHub Pages. The browser app lives in `web/`. The root `index.html` redirects visitors to that folder.
